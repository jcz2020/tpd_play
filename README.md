# Acoustic Harmony

This is a Next.js application for controlling B&O speakers.

## Getting Started

To get the application running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
3.  Install the necessary dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. By default, it will be accessible at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your web browser.

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
